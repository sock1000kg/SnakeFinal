## Introduction
SnakeFinal is a 2D stage-based snake game built with C++, SDL2, and Visual Studio.  
Your main task is to help the snake eat all the apples and move on to the next stage until you’ve cleared them all. Since the snake dies when hitting walls, you’ll want to keep deaths to a minimum — otherwise people will say *“Skill issue”* and laugh at you 😱.  
If things get too tough, you can always restart or get some encouragement from the snake 🐍 (just click on it when it’s smiling).

## Features
- Randomly generated obstacles and apples
- Stages with increasing level of difficulty (more apples required, more obstacles)
- Music and sound effects

## How to Play
- **W, A, S, D** – change snake’s direction  
- **R** – restart the game  
- **M** – mute the music (you’ll need this if you die too much)  
- **Left Mouse Click** – get cheered on by the snake (only when it’s smiling)  

## Note
This was my first experiment with C++/SDL2 and programming in general.  
The project was created as a learning exercise, so I didn’t add cross-platform build tools (like CMake).  
If you’d like to run it, you’ll need to configure SDL2 manually in Visual Studio.
